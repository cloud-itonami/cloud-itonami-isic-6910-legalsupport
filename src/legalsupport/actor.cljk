  "LegalSupportActor — the ISIC Rev.5 6910 AI legal-document and
  procedure-support actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  operation request (intake → advise → govern → decide → commit/hold,
  with a human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit           (:ok? true)
                                            +-> :request-approval (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                            +-> :hold             (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the advisor can never deliver an output
  the governor refuses — every `commit-record!` call is gated behind
  `:decide`. Committed records carry the `:citations` the governor
  relied on, so the audit ledger answers not only *what was delivered*
  but *on what cited legal authority the delivery was believed lawful*."
